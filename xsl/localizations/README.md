MathBook XML Localizations
==========================

Each file in this directory provides translations of various strings used in titles and headings (and other places) to a specific language.  Filenames reflect the code for language (lowercase) and then the code for the region (uppercase).

A summary, and much more explanation, can be found in the file `xsl/mathbook-localization.xsl` which is a master file that includes each file here.  In particular, there are explanations of how to contribute missing strings, or contribute a complete translation for a new language.
